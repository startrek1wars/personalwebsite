<p>
As a student in early high school, I have almost as much free time as I did in early elementary school. This is because I only have a moderate amount of homework and studying to do. As a result, I have the time to read books, build models, and play video games. For as long as I can remember, my primary interests have been science fiction and aerospace. Read on for more information!

<h2 class="nomargin"><i>Star Trek</i></h2>
<p>
<i>Star Trek</i> has been my main interest ever since seventh grade. While I didn't watch many episodes, I discovered <i>Star Trek</i> books at my local library. After about three months of reading, I began to explore deeper in to the franchise. I watched episodes, played video games, and built models. I have become attached to all <i>Star Trek</i> from the Prime Universe-in other words, I am not as attached to the recent 2009 and 2013 <i>Star Trek</i> movies.
</p>


<h3><i>Star Trek</i> Books</h3>

<p class="nomargin">
Reading <i>Star Trek</i> books is an activity that I do almost continuously, from the moment that I wake up to the moment that I fall asleep. In fact, my friends tell me that I ran into a pole while I was walking to class and reading a <i>Star Trek</i> book. However, I do not remember this accident. I follow many different series of books by multiple authors, but many of the characters in the books overlap. Also, most of the books take place in the 2370-2390 timeframe.
</p>
<p>
In reading these novels, I have become attached to many storylines and characters. This is one of the reasons why I will keep reading these novels even if a book or two of the series is of poor quality.

<h3><i>Star Trek</i>: Online</h3>

<p class="hobbiesp2">
When I started becoming interested in <i>Star Trek</i>, I began searching for a <i>Star Trek</i> video game to play. I finally found one in <i>Star Trek</i>: Online. <i>Star Trek</i>: Online is a video game developed by Cryptic Studios and owned by Perfect World Entertainment. It went live on February 2, 2010. I began playing the game when it went free-to-play in February of 2012. In the game, I play as a Starfleet captain who explores the galaxy on the ground and in space. In the latest update, Starfleet discovered a huge Dyson Sphere in the Delta Quadrant of the galaxy, inhabited by modified dinosaurs from Earth.

<p class="hobbiesp3">
The game, now four years old, is a third-person MMORPG, meaning that it is a game that is meant to be played with other people. It also means that the game receives updates, called seasons, every couple of months. Thus, unlike normal games, where a gamer will play for twenty hours and then be finished, <i>Star Trek</i>: Online can be played for as long as the developers continue to create seasons. In addition to playing the game, I also listen to podcasts about the game. Here is an example:

<h3><i>Star Trek</i> Models</h3>

<p class="hobbiesp4">
Another hobby of mine is to create <i>Star Trek</i> models out of paper. Some of these models I design and build myself. Others are designed on the internet. These I print out and build myself.
<br />
<br />
Building <i>Star Trek</i> models is an extremely satisfying endeavour. It is extremely cheap, because all I need is paper, color pencils, tape, and glue. It also results in a tangible representation of my time and effort. Plus, it's fun! However, each model requires much time and effort, and sometimes I stop working. In fact, in my room, I have many incomplete models that I never bothered to finish.

<h2>Aerospace</h2>
<p class="hobbiesp5">
In addition to science-fiction flying machines, I also love real flying machines. When I was little, my father introduced me to airplanes. Nowadays, I love to earn about airplanes new and old. My favorites are the latest and greatest airplanes, such as the Boeing 787, an advanced passenger jet, and the Lockheed Martin F-35, an experimental fighter-bomber. 
<br />
<br />
I love to read books about airplanes and autobiographies about pilots. I also like to build plastic paper models and fly airplanes in Flight Simulator X. However, I do these activities less often than, say, reading <i>Star Trek</i> books.
